# Assamese Text Summarization using LLaMA3-70B

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on **Automatic Text Summarization for Assamese Language**, a low-resource language, using **Prompt Engineering techniques** with the **LLaMA3-70B model**.  
The goal is to generate concise and meaningful summaries for Assamese news articles and evaluate them using **ROUGE** and **BERTScore** metrics.

---

## üìÇ Dataset
We collected datasets from **Kaggle** containing Assamese news articles:
- **News18** ‚Üí 6,000 articles  
- **NENow** ‚Üí 17,000 articles  

For evaluation, we created a custom dataset by generating summaries for **100 random articles** using different prompting techniques.

## üîß Methodology
The project follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and formatting Assamese text.  

2. **Prompt Engineering with LLaMA3-70B**  
   - **Zero-Shot Prompting** ‚Üí Directly generating summaries without examples.  
   - **Few-Shot Prompting** ‚Üí Providing sample summaries as context.  
   - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** ‚Üí Encouraging step-by-step reasoning before summarization.  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - **ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L** ‚Üí Based on n-gram overlap.  
   - **BERTScore** ‚Üí Semantic similarity using contextual embeddings.  

4. **Error Analysis**  
   - Identified issues such as **loss of context, overgeneralization, and hallucination**.

## üîç Observations
- **Zero-Shot** prompting surprisingly outperformed Few-Shot and CoT.  
- Possible reason ‚Üí Assamese summaries are **simple, factual, and concise**, aligning better with Zero-Shot outputs.  
- **ROUGE** scores were relatively lower due to its reliance on word overlap, while **BERTScore** captured semantic similarity more effectively.  

---

## üöÄ Web Application
- Developed a **Flask-based web app** where users can input Assamese news text and generate summaries using different prompts.  
- Summaries are displayed with their **evaluation metrics** for analysis.  

---

## üìà Future Work
- **Prompt Optimization** ‚Üí Improve phrasing and structure of Few-Shot and CoT prompts.  
- **Domain-Specific Summarization** ‚Üí Design prompts for specific domains (politics, health, etc.).  
- **Larger Evaluation Dataset** ‚Üí Use more diverse news datasets for robust testing.  
- **Fine-Tuning** ‚Üí Train/fine-tune LLaMA or similar models on Assamese-specific data for better performance.

## üèÜ Conclusion
- This work demonstrates the feasibility of **LLMs in low-resource languages** like Assamese using **prompt engineering**.  
- Our analysis shows that **Zero-Shot prompting** can outperform Few-Shot and CoT in factual summarization tasks.  
- With improved prompting and fine-tuning, this approach can contribute significantly to **Assamese NLP research**.
